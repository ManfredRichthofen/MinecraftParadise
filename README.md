# Minecraft Paradise
We present you the brand new Modpack Minecraft Paradise from our Team "Team Paradise". Its is a questbased modpack with many mods you have to use. Most of the time you can use the Questbook but sometimes you need the Mod book, because we can't copy any Quest from Mod Developer. We are working on more quests as soon as possible to make it easier to get into each mod. Our problems are on the give-take side because we are often not sure which rewards we should distribute.

## Our Team

We are a Team of four People. But to be honest one of us is only for questions. Due to some personal reasons I am the only person working on it now. So please apologize if I am not that fast you wish. I try to figue out any bugs and problems we have and had during the development.

### Getting Started
For our modpack you need at least on Program:
 * Twitch Launcher
 
Additional we recommend a Texture Pack cause we have big Problems with the Blood Altar and Chiseld Blood Runes. We are sorry about that. A fix will come as soon as possible
